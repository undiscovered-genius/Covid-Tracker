# How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

# Coding conventions
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

> We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
> We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.
> This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
